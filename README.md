## üîí What is CAPTCHA & Why Use It?

CAPTCHA stands for **Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart**. It's a system designed to **distinguish real users from bots** by presenting tasks that are easy for humans but difficult for machines.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Prevent **spam form submissions**
- Protect **login and registration pages**
- Secure **comment sections** on blogs or forums
- Block **automated abuse** on voting or feedback forms

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

This CAPTCHA system is designed with **user privacy and lightweight security** in mind:

- No third-party tracking or analytics
- No data is stored or shared
- Audio and image CAPTCHAs are locally generated (or can be)
- You can extend it with a **server-side validation layer** for enhanced protection

While it's simple and open-source, it's best used for **educational purposes** or **basic protection**. For high-security apps, consider integrating proven CAPTCHA services (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA) with stronger backend logic.
